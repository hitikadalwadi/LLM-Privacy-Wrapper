# LLM-Privacy-Wrapper
Designed to protect sensitive information when interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs). It allows you to encode sensitive words or phrases in your input text with innocent replacements before sending it to the LLM, and then decode the LLM's response to restore the original sensitive information.
